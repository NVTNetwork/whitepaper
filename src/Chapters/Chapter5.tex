The increasing amount of research studying Internet recommendation systems is evidence of the increasing role of recommendation systems in consumersâ€™ online shopping environments. Assessing the value of a product is crucial to informed marketing, including well planned advertising, brand portfolio planning, channel placement, cross selling initiatives, pricing, and compensation of marketing personnel. Understanding the network value of products is thus of essential importance for marketers.

In the early 90s, most web pages were created by academic institutions or magazines, and mostly contained plain text and hyperlinks to other sites. Over the next few years, the number of web pages grew exponentially, and online product retailers started to think about ways to expand. As the share of online purchases increases, the ability of firms to measure and affect network value will grow. Therefore, the NVT network should be a significant step toward a better understanding of this important concept.
