The \textit{Network Value Token (NVT Network)} is a decentralized platform for listing and assessing product network value, with its aim being to align manufacturer interests with those of their users. In this way, we cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship between the two parties. This is accomplished by (1) promoting manufacturer rewards, (2) rewarding user predictions, (3) streamlining the product-discovery pipeline and (4) staking a fair and equal share of the product decision-making process to each network user. Overlaying the \textit{NVT Network} on the surface level is the \textit{NVT Community}, a novel online information community for product reviewing. The \textit{NVT Community} consists of four user types: (a) Creators, (b) Explorers, (c) Moderators and (d) Product Users. The \textit{NVT Network} forms the basis for a product-based prediction market, where market metrics are derived from product network value. We construct a robust pricing system which incentivizes users to discover and share products within the network, allowing the best content to rise to the top of the \textit{NVT Community}. What fuels the \textit{NVT Network}, which we keep open and accessible to all users, is the \textit{NVT Token}. The network rewards \textit{NVT Tokens} for user contributions, making it a network participation a net benefit for everyone.The \textit{NVT Community} is deployed on \textit{NVT Network's} native blockchain, guaranteeing which accessibility, performance, transparency, and speed. For the first time in the technology sector, the \textit{NVT Network} implements a decentralized, user-generated product-review ecosystem, one driven by both fairness and quality.
